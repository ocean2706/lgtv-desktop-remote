## lgcommander.py
lgcommander.py is a python script for controlling your Smart Lg TV with your PC.
It can be used for gaining access to hidden menus and modes.

## To use it you need:
A PC, with python 3.x installed, connected to the same network as your Lg TV.

## Some useful codes:

* for EZ_ADJUST menu enter 255
* for IN START menu enter 251
* for Installation menu enter 207
* for POWER_ONLY mode enter 254

Warning: do not enter 254 if you do not know what POWER_ONLY mode is. You can find additional information about menus and modes here: <http://openlgtv.org.ru>   
 
As long as you do not "factory reset" your TV, pairing key doesn't change. You can use an editor to modify the line:

    lgtv["pairingKey"] = "DDGWAF"    

to suit your TV's actual pairing key.  This will eliminate the pairing key acquisition stage.


## Windows users:
You can avoid the black console window if you change the "py" file extension to "pyw".

## Newer LG Smart TV (year 2012) models:
Benke Tam√°s says: "I wanted to use your lgcommander script, but i realized that its not working with lg 2012 smart tv series. I made some changes, now its working with the new series, but lg changed the keycodes too. Now, there are keycodes above 255 and ez-adjust, in-start code changed too, but i dont know them yet. I attached my version, if you want to improve yours."
I added his version of the script as lg_2012_commander.py
